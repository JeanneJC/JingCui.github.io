    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Ottawa with research interests in labour economics and applied microeconomics. 

My research focuses on retirement decisions, labour market transitions across business cycles, and the gender unemployment gap. 

My job market paper is about how COVID-19 affects older individuals' retirement transitions.  

I expect to graduate in early 2025, and I'm available for interviews in the 2024-2025 job market. </p>
